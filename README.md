Drat - There's nothing here!

Are you interested in helping us make an official iOS app for Ghost? While the Ghost core team works over in the [main repository](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost), our native apps are all built by open source contributors and are downloaded hundreds of thousands of times. 

Our [desktop app](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost-desktop) is managed by [Felix](https://github.com/felixrieseberg) from Slack and Electron Core, while our [Android app](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost-android) started life as a completely independent project called Quill, created by [Vicky](https://github.com/vickychijwani). The last major platform where we're still looking for someone with a passion for open source native apps is iOS.
